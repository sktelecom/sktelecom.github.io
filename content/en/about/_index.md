## SK Telecom's Open Source Governance

SK Telecom has established a world-class open source management system. To maximize the technical benefits of open source while effectively managing risks related to licenses, security, and intellectual property, SK Telecom operates a systematic governance structure with two pillars: OSRB (decision-making organization) and OSPO (operations organization).

This governance approach transcends mere regulatory compliance and instead pursues a balanced approach where developers can freely utilize open source while the company manages its risks effectively. Through clear policies, transparent processes, and professional support, SK Telecom fosters a symbiotic relationship between corporate development culture and the global open source community.

## OSRB (Open Source Review Board)

OSRB (Open Source Review Board) is the highest decision-making body in SK Telecom's open source governance. Comprising leaders from the technology, legal, infrastructure, and security divisions, OSRB establishes corporate open source policies and makes critical risk-related decisions.

OSRB convenes monthly to review monthly open source compliance status and holds quarterly strategic meetings to discuss mid-to-long-term open source policy directions. When necessary, emergency meetings are called to promptly address security issues, legal disputes, and policy violations.

## OSPO (Open Source Program Office)

OSPO (Open Source Program Office) is the dedicated organization responsible for executing SK Telecom's open source policies and supporting developers. While OSRB handles decision-making, OSPO operationalizes those policies, collaborates with development teams, and provides necessary guidance and support.

OSPO serves as a bridge between developers and the legal team, swiftly resolving various open source-related issues that arise during development. Additionally, OSPO establishes and executes corporate open source strategies while building and maintaining relationships with the global open source community.

## Characteristics of SK Telecom's Open Source Governance

### Transparency and Consistency

SK Telecom's open source governance is founded on transparent policies and consistent processes. Every open source adoption, contribution, and release decision follows clear criteria and processes, with all decisions and their rationales documented. This ensures developers understand what is and isn't possible and why.

### Developer-Centric Support

The ultimate goal of governance is to support developers. OSPO provides guidance enabling developers to freely leverage open source, conducts prior reviews to prevent legal issues, and offers necessary training and consultation. Through this support, developers can maximize open source value while managing company risks.

### International Standards Compliance

SK Telecom's governance is built on the OpenChain international standard. This means following international best practices in open source compliance, officially certified through ISO/IEC 5230 certification. This standards compliance enhances internal trust and facilitates cooperation with global business partners.

### Continuous Improvement

SK Telecom operates its open source governance not as a static system but as a continuously improving process. Policies are refined, processes streamlined, and automation tools developed based on developer feedback, community evolution, and technological advances. Through this approach, SK Telecom's open source management capability continuously improves.

### ISO/IEC 5230 (OpenChain) Certification Achievement

SK Telecom obtained ISO/IEC 5230, the OpenChain international standard by Linux Foundation, in 2021. This certification signifies:

- Establishment of clear open source policies
- Definition of systematic review and approval processes
- Continuous developer training and capability enhancement
- Transparent documentation and tracking of all decisions and activities

Through this systematic governance, SK Telecom strengthens internal confidence, enhances collaboration with the global community, and effectively manages legal risks.
