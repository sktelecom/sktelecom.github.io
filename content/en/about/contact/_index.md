## Online Channels

### GitHub

All of SK Telecom's open source projects are managed through our GitHub Organization.

GitHub Organization: [https://github.com/sktelecom](https://github.com/sktelecom)

You can engage in the following activities in each project's repository:

- Issues: Report bugs, request features, ask questions, and make suggestions. SK Telecom's development team regularly monitors and responds.
- Discussions: Engage in general discussions, share ideas, and participate in community conversations.
- Pull Requests: Contribute code, fix bugs, and suggest improvements to directly participate in projects.

### Security Issue Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in an open source project, we recommend not reporting it as a public issue. Instead, please email the security contact specified in the project's README or SECURITY.md file directly. This prevents vulnerabilities from being exploited before patches are distributed to other users.

When reporting security issues, please include:
- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Reproduction method (PoC, Proof of Concept)
- Impact assessment
- Proposed solution (if available)
