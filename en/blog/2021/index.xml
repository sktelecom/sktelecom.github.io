&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year and half since Jakub posted the &lt;a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/low-latency-streaming-of-security-feeds-with-srt-and-gstreamer.html"&gt;installation document&lt;/a&gt; of Hwangsaeul (a.k.a H8L) project. The project members are still rush to develop the project for the various use cases. Although the H8L project is originally designed to support the massive deployment of video surveillance cameras which enable SRT transmission, we found that there is much more potential when we switch the domain to UAV(Unmanned Areial Viehicle) and UGV(Unmanned Ground Vehicle). Therefore, we had to change the overall shape of H8L to optimize for the new targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
